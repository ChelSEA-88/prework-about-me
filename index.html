      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always tought of myself as "right brained" because I'm creative. What i've realized is that i'm not AS creative as some others, and that I have a some linear thinking and I believe knowledge in Tech may be a missing link in my success. I am striving for a balance in logically reasoning and creative freedom in a career.  </p>
